                    At 10,778 feet in elevation, it is the most isolated of the Cascade volcanoes. &nbsp;Mt.
                    Baker is the third highest mountain in the State of Washington. &nbsp;Baker has
                    an aesthetic shape that “pops up” surprisingly from many vantage points in the Cascades
                    and around Puget Sound. &nbsp;The mountain wears a heavy mantle of ice with exceptional
                    beauty. &nbsp;After Mt. Rainier, it is the most heavily glaciated of the Cascade
                    volcanoes. &nbsp;Due to its many glaciers, local Native Americans gave Mt. Baker
                    a name meaning “White Steep Mountain”.
