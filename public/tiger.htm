                    Issaquah, WA. Tiger is a popular hiking area so close to civilization that it almost
                    feels like cheating to hike there and to find mountain wilderness so close to home.
                    There is a vast menu of hikes to choose from; a hike for everybody….young or old,
                    experienced or new. Tiger Mountain is an excellent place to watch the changing seasons;
                    in spring it is rich with new growth and wild flowers. Tiger Mountain is a place
                    of changing seasons and moods. It is a place to meditate and to dream, to socialize
                    and celebrate life in all its' seasons.
