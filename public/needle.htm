                    The Space Needle is a tower in Seattle, Washington, a major landmark of the Pacific
                    NW and a symbol of Seattle. Located at the Seattle Center, it was built for the
                    1962 World's Fair. It is 605 ft. high and 138 ft. wide at its widest point. When
                    is was completed, it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. It
                    features an observation deck at 520 ft., a gift shop and a rotating restaurant at
                    500 ft. From the top of the needle, one can see not only the downtown Seattle skyline,
                    but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mt. Rainier, Mt. Baker, Elliott Bay
                    and all the surrounding islands.<br />
                    The Needle - at 8152 ft. it is a prominent rock tower on the West margin rim of
                    Neve Glacier. The Needle is identified by a sharp rock block just north of its summit.
                    This is a short, solid rock climb.
