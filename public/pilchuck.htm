                    At 5,340 ft., it is located only a 90 minute drive from Seattle. Save Mount Pilchuck
                    for a &nbsp;clear day, because the views of the Olympics and the Cascades from the
                    old fire lookout on &nbsp;top are the stuff of dreams. This is one of the few short
                    trails in the region that reaches &nbsp;the summit of a major peak. Pilchuck was
                    first climbed in 1897 by topographers; by 1918 the U.S. &nbsp;Forest Service had
                    established a rough trail to the summit. In 1991 the first lookout house was &nbsp;completed
                    and most recently renovated. You may feel like you're in a fairy tale as the trail
                    winds &nbsp;through a giant's garden of boulders, flowers and rivulets.
