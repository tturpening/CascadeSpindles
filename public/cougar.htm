                    Comprised of 3,082 acres with more than 36 miles of trails, Cougar Mountain is surrounded
                    by the cities of Bellevue, Newcastle and Issaquah, and just minutes from downtown
                    Seattle. Equally impressive is the scenery along the way and the interesting destinations
                    that the trails lead to. Among the trail destinations are: a Nike missile site left
                    overfrom the Cold War, coal mining shafts, spectacular waterfalls, a restored meadow
                    that was once a baseball field in the 1920's, a former mining town site, large glacier
                    boulders, caves and mountain top view points.
